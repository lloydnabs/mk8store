A graphical frontend to the [get package manager](https://github.com/vgmoose/libget) for downloading and managing homebrew on video game consoles, such as the Nintendo Switch and Wii U. This is a replacement to the older [Wii U Homebrew App Store](https://github.com/vgmoose/wiiu-hbas).

## Supported Platforms
### Nintendo Switch
To run this program, a Nintendo Switch with access to the Homebrew Menu is required. This can be done on most Switches manufactured before July 2018, for compatibility check your serial number at [ismyswitchpatched.com](https://ismyswitchpatched.com). To run hbmenu, see the tutorial [here](https://guide.sdsetup.com/).

Extract the latest [hb-appstore](https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore/releases) to `sd:/switch/appstore/`, and run "hb App Store" from within hbmenu. When you're done, you can press the Minus (-) button to exit.

### Wii U
To run this program, a Wii U with access to the Homebrew Launcher is required. This can be done on any firmware. To run the Homebrew Launcher, see the tutorial [here](https://wiiu.hacks.guide).

Extract the latest [hb-appstore](https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore/releases) to `sd:/wiiu/apps/appstore/`, and run "hb App Store" from within Homebrew Launcher. When you're done, you can press the Minus (-) button to exit.

## Maintaining a repo
See [get's instructions](https://github.com/vgmoose/get#setting-up-repos) for setting up a repository. Everything is designed to be statically hosted. If there's no repo provided in the `repos.json` config file, then it will generate a default one pointing to [switchbru.com/appstore](http://switchbru.com/appstore/).

If you run into any issues and need help maintaining or setting up a libget repo, feel free to get in touch with vgmoose at me@vgmoose.com or on Discord.

## Compilation instructions
This program is written using SDL2 and has dependencies on libsdl, libcurl, and zlib. It also makes use of libget which is included in this repo as a submodule.

### Building for Switch (with libnx)
1. Install [dkp-pacman](https://devkitpro.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=8702)
2. Install devkitA64 and needed Switch dependencies via dkp-pacman:
```
sudo dkp-pacman -S devkitA64 libnx switch-tools switch-curl switch-bzip2 switch-freetype switch-libjpeg-turbo switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_gfx switch-sdl2_image switch-sdl2_ttf switch-zlib switch-libpng switch-mesa
```
3. Once it's all setup, recursively clone the repo and run make:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore.git
cd hb-appstore
make -f Makefile.switch
```

If all goes well, `appstore.nro` should be sitting in the current directory.

### Building for Wii U (with WUT)
The below instructions are currently for Linux and macOS
1. Install [dkp-pacman](https://devkitpro.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=8702)
2. Setup [wiiu-fling](https://gitlab.com/QuarkTheAwesome/wiiu-fling#wiiu-fling) according to the instructions
3. Install sdl2, wut, devkitPPC and other dependencies (on macOS, use `wut-osx` instead of `wut-linux`)
```
sudo dkp-pacman -S wut-linux wiiu-sdl2 devkitPPC wiiu-libromfs wiiu-sdl2_gfx wiiu-sdl2_image wiiu-sdl2_ttf wiiu-sdl2_mixer ppc-zlib ppc-bzip2 ppc-freetype ppc-libpng ppc-mpg123 wiiu-curl-headers ppc-pkg-config wiiu-pkg-config
```
4. Once the environment is setup:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore.git
cd hb-appstore
make -f Makefile.wiiu
```

If all goes well, `appstore.rpx` should be sitting in the current directory.

### Building for PC (with Buck)
This project is moving towards [Buck](https://github.com/facebook/buck) to build and [Buckaroo](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/) for dependency management.

1. Install a [precompiled Buck](https://github.com/facebook/buck/releases), and [precompiled Buckaroo](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo/releases) for your platform, or build them from source
2. Run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore.git
cd hb-appstore
buckaroo install
buck build :hb-appstore
```

Currently sdl2 is manually linked in the `.buckconfig`, as a buckaroo port is not yet available, so SDL2 will need to be installed via the system package manager (see below). After running the above, there should be a binary sitting in `./buck-out/gen/hb-appstore`.

#### Using GNU Makefile
There's a separate makefile for building the SDL2 app for PC, if you don't want to try the Buck build. Below instructions are for Ubuntu, but should be similar on other platforms:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev zlib1g-dev gcc g++ git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vgmoose/hb-appstore.git
cd hb-appstore
make -f Makefile.pc
```

It's not required, but running a clang-format before making a PR helps to clean up styling issues:
```
find . \( -name "*.cpp" -or -name "*.hpp" \) -not -path "./libs/*" -exec clang-format -i {} \;
```
